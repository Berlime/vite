Complex solutions may require custom hardware to perform tasks or automations. This requires us to develop custom computer device to fulfill the needs. Analyzing required specification based on use case and potential upscaling if needed.

We design and build custom hardware solutions tailored to your specific business requirements.

Rather than simply procuring off-the-shelf devices, our team develops specialized equipment configurations using industrial-grade components to create purpose-built systems.

From initial analysis through assembly and testing, we ensure the final hardware precisely matches your technical needs while maintaining reliability and performance standards.




## Service Charges

We outlined a structure of charges based on the price range of equipment cost, labor, resources & etc.

- **Price Range:** Different ranges of equipment costs prices, from S$500 to above S$100,000.
- **Charges:** Percentage charged based on the price range. The percentage decreases as the price range increases.
- **Minimum Value:** The minimum amount of service charge or maintenance fee in Singapore dollars (S$) for each price range.
- **Total:** The combined total cost including the equipment cost price plus the service charge.

For example, if the total cost priced between S$500 and S$10,000, the charge is 30%, resulting in a minimum value of S$150 to S$3,000. The total cost would be between S$650 and S$13,000.
