# Custom Devices

::: info Overview
We design and build [custom hardware](/introduction/glossaries.html#custom-hardware) solutions tailored to your specific business requirements. Our specialized equipment is designed to solve complex technical challenges that off-the-shelf products cannot address.
:::

## Our Process

Complex business solutions may require custom devices to perform specialized tasks or [automations](/introduction/glossaries.html#automation). We develop custom computing hardware by:

1. Analyzing your specific requirements and use cases
2. Evaluating potential scaling needs
3. Selecting appropriate [industrial-grade components](/introduction/glossaries.html#industrial-grade-components)
4. Building and testing the complete solution

Rather than simply procuring off-the-shelf devices, our team develops specialized equipment configurations that create purpose-built systems designed for reliability and performance.

## Pricing

::: warning Equipment Pricing Structure
Our pricing is based on a sliding scale where the percentage fee decreases as the equipment cost increases, providing better value for larger projects.
