# Custom Devices

We design and build [custom hardware](/introduction/glossaries.html#custom-hardware) solutions tailored to your specific business requirements. Our specialized equipment is designed to solve complex technical challenges that off-the-shelf products cannot address.

## Examples

### Simple Example

Custom Temperature Sensor

For a small-scale agricultural business, we developed a custom temperature sensor that integrates with their existing irrigation system. This sensor provides real-time temperature data, allowing the system to adjust water flow based on current weather conditions, optimizing water usage and improving crop yield.

### Complex Example

Automated Manufacturing Line

For a large manufacturing company, we engineered a fully automated production line. This system includes custom-built robotic arms, conveyor systems, and quality control sensors. The entire setup is controlled by a centralized software platform that monitors production metrics, adjusts operations in real-time, and provides detailed analytics for process optimization. This solution significantly increased production efficiency and reduced operational costs.

## Our Process

Complex business solutions may require custom devices to perform specialized tasks or [automations](/introduction/glossaries.html#automation). We develop custom computing hardware by:

1. Analyzing your specific requirements and use cases
2. Evaluating potential scaling needs
3. Selecting appropriate [industrial-grade components](/introduction/glossaries.html#industrial-grade-components)
4. Building and testing the complete solution

Rather than simply procuring off-the-shelf devices, our team develops specialized equipment configurations that create purpose-built systems designed for reliability and performance.
