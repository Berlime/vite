<p style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 600">Softwares</p>

Softwares are sometimes referred as [plug-ins](/introduction/glossaries.html#plug-in). A plug-in extends a functionality of an existing software.

The term 'Plug-In' is widely use on WordPress, though WordPress is a powerful [Content Management System](/introduction/glossaries.html#cms).

::: info TL;DR
On this page, you'll learn how we determine the costs associated with the plug-ins and software that we purchase, set up, configure, and maintain for you. This includes both proprietary software (paid) and open-source software (free).
:::

## What We Offer

We provide cost transparency by breaking down the pricing of each plug-in or software, so you know exactly what you're paying for. We handle the setup and configuration, ensuring the software works perfectly with your systems. Our ongoing maintenance ensures everything runs smoothly, and we help you optimize the usage of each plug-in and software according to your needs.

Not be confused that this page is talking about adding plug-ins or software (‘add-ons’).

These pricing does not apply when you take any one-time website development packages with us which already included.

## Selection Criteria

We carefully select the plug-ins and software based on a set of criteria to ensure they meet our quality standards and your requirements. This includes compatibility to ensure the software works well with your existing systems, functionality to offer the best features and performance for your needs, security to prioritize safe and reliable software to protect your data, and cost-effectiveness to provide the best value for money.

### Criteria List

1. It is registered company in their respective location. For example, if the plug-in is from Germany, it should have something like GmbH.
2. The plug-in must publish an update no longer than 3 months ago.
3. Have a recurring payment structure. (One time payment usually leads to sustainability which the developer may stop working on it altogether)
4. Have at least 2 months old published content in their website/YouTube or any other channels.
5. Have an active and reliable closed community. (e.g. Facebook Page, Discord, Circle… etc.)
6. Have at least 4-star reviews from the marketplace.

## Pricing Structure

For plug-ins that require maintenance, which most plug-ins is required if not all. This is billed monthly or annually. (An ongoing subscription in order to maintain, monitor & keep up with the updates) This is important because plug-ins and software's will have new feature which requires our end to test, validate and deploy. Also to ensure that the plug-ins will always be optimized.

### Determine the Cost

Plug-ins/softwares may have a cheaper option if bought in bulk that includes licenses for multiple websites especially for WordPress sites.

We will always count the ‘Single License’ instead of the bulk price. If we happened to have the unlimited lifetime license. We may not even charge extra for this. Usually we charge when there is some sort of ongoing maintenance is required for the website to run/function that is the main functionality for the website. There are 2 parts of cost involved, see below.

### 1. Service cost threshold

In order to ensure transparency and clear communication with customers, we apply a structured service charge based on the price range of the product or service. Below is the table outlining the applicable service charge percentages and the resultant total cost range for each price bracket:

First S$1000

| **Price Range (S$)** | **Mark-Up (%)** | **Total Cost Range (S$)** |
|-----------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|

| S$701 - S$800         | 24%             | ~ S$982 - S$992          |
| S$801 - S$900         | 20%             | ~ S$1082 - S$1080        |
| S$901 - S$1000        | 20%             | ~ S$1172 - S$1200        |

After S$1000 to S$20,000

| **Price Range (S$)** | **Mark-Up (%)** | **Total Cost Range (S$)** |
|-----------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|

| S$19,001 - S$20,000   | 5%              | ~ S$19,951 - S$21,000    |

::: info Note
After S$20,000. The range mark up is from <5% to a minimum of 1%.

### 2. Complexity threshold

The second cost you need to consider is based on the complexity of the configuration. Ranging from Level 1 to Level 20. The higher the level, the more complex it is to set-up, maintain and adapt to updates from the developer.

This cost is multiplied by the Level's percentage value from the **SOFTWARE COST ONLY** and not `software cost` + `service cost`.

::: info So the final equation would be something like this:
`Total Price` =

`Software Cost` + `Software Cost x Service Cost Level` + `Software Cost x Complexity Cost Level`
:::

This ensures that the software or plug-in performs efficiently and accounts for the effort and resources involved in each stage.

Below is the simplified table showing the mark-up percentages based on the complexity level & a brief description as a general guide:

| **Levels** | **Increase (%)** | **Description**                                 |

| Level 2    | 14%              | Simple configuration with standard options.     |
| Level 3    | 18%              | Basic setup with additional settings.           |
| Level 4    | 22%              | Moderate configuration with some custom options.|
| Level 5    | 26%              | Standard setup plus minor customizations.       |

::: info Note:
Each level includes the steps of the previous levels, adding additional setup, configuration, maintenance, and optimization steps.
