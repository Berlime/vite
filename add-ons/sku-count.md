# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

Let's determine the extra commitment required if your store have a lot of products. Before we get into it, e-commerce have an extra maintenance tasks to peform on top of the main website's maintenance. Its a seperate system that sits on top of the main website.

::: tip Factors that we consider:
- Server Resources: Each product takes up space and bandwidth into the server.
- Google Indexing: We need to index each product on Google to ensure its discoverable by potential customers.
- Maintenance Tasks: Continuous efforts are required to maintain site speed, performance and fulfilling change requests. Mostly involves eCommerce related updates & optimizations. (Different from Core Maintenance)
- Database: Store order data for at least 5 years for report & analytics as well as compliance reasons.

## Extra Costs

The extra commitment to consider as you increase the product/variation count. Out of the box, every [e-commerce website package](/website-packages/online-shop-websites.html) will have 100 SKUs included. After 100 SKUs, see below:

Here are what we consider an SKU.

- A product.
- A variation of a product.
- A grouped product. (Regardless of how many child product)
- Custom field with pricing. Determined by `product fields add-on` plug-in.
- Custom condition. Each condition created is counted as one SKU.

| SKU(s) Count        |Extra Costs      |
| ------------------- | :-------------: | 
| 100*                 | S$0/m           |                                
| 200                 | S$150/m         | 
| 300                 | S$300/m         | 
| 400                 | S$450/m         | 
| ... and so on       | + S$150 per 100 SKUs        |

<ul style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.6); font-size: 14px; line-height: 1rem; list-style-type: none; padding-left: 6px">
    <li><i>*If you want to add e-commerce funtionality but do not took up e-commerce website package. Your first 100 SKUs is S$150/m. Note that this is just a basic built-in e-commerce features without any extra features.</i></li>

</ul>

::: info Example

The table above shows that one SKU costs S$1.50 per month. Billed every 100 SKUs. So, every 100 SKUs, will add S$150. 

Assuming you took an e-commerce website pacakge and have 200 SKUs, the extra cost monthly is S$150 as the SKU exceeds the 100 SKU count.

Then, the next few months you want to add a few more products and variations.

After adding new products and variations, the total SKUs is 199. The extra cost monthly is still S$150 as you do not exceed the 200 SKU count.

## Sales Volume

Some online store may have only 1 product and a few variations which probably takes up between 5 to 10 SKUs.
Previously, we have discussed if an online store have multiple products:

In this metrics, on top of the extra SKU count cost incured (if applicable), here are the extra cost to consider based on per order.

| Order Count              |Extra Costs      |
| -------------------      | :-------------: | 
| 100/week                 | S$50/m          |                                
| 200/week                 | S$100/m         | 
| 300/week                 | S$150/m         | 
| 400/week                 | S$200/m         | 
| ... and so on            | + S$50 per 100 orders per week        | 


::: info Note:

If a person purchase 100 products in one checkout. It is still counted as one order.
