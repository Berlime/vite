# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

Let's determine the extra commitment required if your store have a lot of products. Before we get into it, e-commerce have an extra maintenance tasks to peform on top of the main website's maintenance. Its a seperate system that sits on top of the main website.

::: tip Factors that we consider:
- Server Resources: Each product takes up space and bandwidth into the server.
- Google Indexing: We need to index each product on Google to ensure its discoverable by potential customers.
- Maintenance Tasks: Continuous efforts are required to maintain site speed, performance and fulfilling change requests. Mostly involves eCommerce related updates & optimizations. (Different from Core Maintenance)
- Database: Store order data for at least 5 years for report & analytics as well as compliance reasons.

## Extra Costs

The extra commitment to consider as you increase the product/variation count. Out of the box, every e-commerce website package will have 100 SKUs included. After 100 SKUs, see below:

| SKU(s) Count        |Extra Costs      |
| ------------------- | :-------------: | 
| 100                 | S$0/m           |                                
| 200                 | S$150/m         | 
| 300                 | S$300/m         | 
| 400                 | S$450/m         | 
| ... and so on       | + S$150 per 100 SKUs        | 

The table above shows that one SKU costs S$1.50 per month. Billed every 100 SKUs. So, every 100 SKUs, will add S$150. 

::: warning Example

If your online store have 101 SKUs, the extra cost monthly is S$150 as the SKU exceeds the 100 SKU count.

Then, the next few months you want to add a few more products and variations.

After adding new products and variations, the total SKUs is 199. The extra cost monthly is still S$150 as you do not exceed the 200 SKU count.

## Sales Volume

Some online store may have only 1 product and a few variations which probably takes up between 5 to 10 SKUs.
Previously, we have discussed if an online store have multiple products.

In this metrics, we do not take up the percentage of the total sales. Instead, we count by per order.

::: info Note:

If a person purchase 100 products in one checkout. It is still counted as one order.

:::

| Order Count              |Extra Costs      |
| -------------------      | :-------------: | 
| 100/week                 | S$50/m          |                                
| 200/week                 | S$100/m         | 
| 300/week                 | S$150/m         | 
| 400/week                 | S$200/m         | 
| ... and so on            | + S$50 per 100 orders per week        | 


::: danger Important

We will only charge whichever is higher. If the Sales Volume is higher, we will ommit the SKU count charges.
