Backup storage serves as a critical safety net for your data. It ensures that your important files and information are safeguarded against loss from various risks such as accidental deletion, hardware failures, or malicious attacks like ransomware. By regularly backing up your website data, you maintain a secure copy that can be restored if your primary data is compromised.

### Disaster Recovery

In the event of a disaster, whether it's natural (like a flood or fire) or man-made (like a cyberattack), having backup storage allows you to quickly restore your data and resume operations. This capability is vital for minimizing downtime and mitigating the impact of unexpected events on your business or personal activities.

Your primary website data typically is stored in the server. On top of that, we also create a few copies of your website data else where at another data-center or even offilne.

### Compliance and Legal

Many industries and jurisdictions have stringent regulations regarding data retention and protection. Backup storage helps organizations comply with these regulations by ensuring that data is stored securely and can be retrieved when necessary. This compliance not only avoids legal penalties but also demonstrates a commitment to data integrity and security.

At least, in Singapore, businesses are required to maintain a 5 year data-log, especially if the website or application have any transactions involved. Storing these data in the main primary website server will bring your website slow.

This also acts as a prevention measure of data leaked when we no longer need old data for the primary website.
