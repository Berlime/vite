::: info Development Details

If the project does not foresee a drastic change in the future in terms of features and complexity, we will use [Static Site Generators](https://jamstack.org/generators/) to fulfill this.

Our team will decide what platform is suitable based on the information we exchange so that it is still scalable.

You may also want to refer to [add-ons](#) to customize your maintenance plan further. For example, you chose the `cp0` maintenance plan, but want to add-on one business e-mail instead of getting the next tier (`cp0.5`) which includes extras you might not need.
