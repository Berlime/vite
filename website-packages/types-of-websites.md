# Types of websites

Website design and development is `very complex by nature`. Usually, website development services do not usually have a fixed price upfront.

This is because each website may have a unique approach, design, features, goals, demands & many other requirements. Even the simplest websites you can imagine will need some level of requirment, goals and design needs.

Generally, `the more features a website has, the more it will cost`.
Additionally, design complexity, user experience & other factors also contribute to the total cost.
