# Types of websites

Website design and development is `very complex by nature`. Usually, website development services do not usually have a fixed price upfront.

This is because each website may have a unique approach, design, features, goals, demands & many other requirements. Even the simplest websites you can imagine will need some level of requirment, goals and design needs.

Generally, `the more features a website has, the more it will cost`.
Additionally, design complexity, user experience & other factors also contribute to the total cost.

In this section, we lay out an easy overview what we have to offer to make web design & development accessible to all size of businesses.

We crafted `data-driven` packages grouped in tiers that is suitable for everyone. From a `solo-preneur`, all the way to [SMEs](/introduction/glossaries.html#sme).
