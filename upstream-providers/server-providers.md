# Types of servers

Choosing the right server provider is crucial for ensuring optimal performance, scalability, and ease of deployment. This document explores various server providers that cater to different needs, from static site hosting to serverless computing.

Each provider offers unique features and advantages, making it essential to understand their capabilities to make informed decisions based on project requirements.

Traditional dedicated servers provide full control over hardware and software but require significant maintenance. Virtual Private Servers (VPS) offer a balance between control and management, allowing multiple virtual servers to run on shared hardware while maintaining isolation.

Cloud servers, provided by services like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure, offer scalable infrastructure with pay-as-you-go pricing models. These platforms provide various services from basic compute instances to managed services.

Managed servers offload maintenance tasks to the service provider, allowing developers to focus on application development rather than infrastructure management.

Container-based servers, utilizing technologies like Docker and Kubernetes, enable consistent deployment across different environments and efficient resource utilization. Each server type has its advantages and considerations, making it crucial to evaluate project requirements before selecting a hosting solution.

## CDN

Content Delivery Network (CDN): While not a traditional server, this option is a good start for small websites.

### 1. **Netlify**

Netlify is a platform for deploying and managing modern web projects, especially static sites and JAMstack applications. It offers continuous deployment from Git repositories and serverless functions for backend logic.

Netlify also includes a built-in CI/CD, CDN, and global edge network. It supports frameworks like React, Vue, and Gatsby, making it ideal for seamless deployment and scalability.

### 3. **Cloudflare Pages**

Cloudflare Pages is a JAMstack platform for deploying static sites using Cloudflare’s global network. It features Git-integrated continuous deployment and fast delivery through Cloudflare’s edge network.

It supports custom domains, preview deployments, and serverless functions via Cloudflare Workers, making it great for leveraging Cloudflare’s infrastructure for static site hosting.

### 4. **AWS Lambda**

AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service by AWS, allowing code execution without server management. It supports event-driven execution, like triggers from API Gateway or S3.

Lambda scales automatically with usage and follows a pay-as-you-go pricing model, ideal for backend logic, microservices, and event-driven applications.

### 5. **GitHub Pages**

GitHub Pages is a free hosting service for static websites directly from a GitHub repository. It allows simple deployment using HTML, CSS, and JS.

Supporting custom domains and HTTPS, GitHub Pages integrates with GitHub repositories for easy updates, perfect for personal projects and documentation.

## Shared Hosting

Shared hosting is a cost-effective solution where multiple websites share server resources, ideal for small projects with moderate traffic. A huge bump in performance from CDN is a huge advantage.

### 1. **Hostinger**

Hostinger balances performance and cost, allowing Git forks or branches and Python deployment. It supports simple WordPress sites and large static websites.

This makes Hostinger suitable for small businesses and individuals with a focus on speed and reliability.

### 2. **A2 Hosting**

A2 Hosting is known for fast loading speeds and reliable service. It is by far the best shared hosting provider.

While leveraging the legacy cPanel.

## VPS Hosting

Virtual Private Server (VPS) hosting provides dedicated resources and greater control while being more cost-effective than dedicated servers.

These are the providers for dedicated servers as well.

### 1. **Contabo**

Contabo offers high-performance VPS solutions at competitive prices. By far the most generous specifications per dollar.

This is the entry level provider to leverage the best performance and value.

### 2. **Digital Ocean**

### 5. **GBCloud**

GBCloud offers reliable VPS hosting solutions with a focus on performance and scalability. It provides dedicated resources and robust infrastructure across multiple regions, with particularly strong presence in Southeast Asia (SEA).

With competitive pricing, strong technical support, and data centers strategically located in SEA regions, GBCloud is an excellent choice for businesses targeting Southeast Asian markets or requiring low-latency hosting solutions in the region.

:::warning VPS Instance requires self-management.
VPS instances requires Server managers that simplify the process of managing VPS instances through user-friendly web interfaces. Instead of dealing with complex command-line operations.

For complex projects, we may opt out server management and use CLI operations.
