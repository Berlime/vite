## A

### Automation

Automation refers to the use of technology to perform tasks with minimal human intervention. In a business context, automation involves implementing systems that can carry out repetitive processes automatically, increasing efficiency and reducing human error. Examples include automated data entry, scheduled backups, content publishing, email responses, and inventory management. Custom automation solutions often combine hardware and software to address specific business needs that cannot be met by off-the-shelf products.

### Availability

Availability refers to the percentage of time a system or service is operational and accessible when needed. In cloud storage and website contexts, availability is typically measured as a percentage (e.g., 99.99% or "four nines"), indicating the maximum acceptable downtime. For mission-critical websites, high availability configurations ensure continuous service even during hardware failures or maintenance.

## B

### Backup Types

There are three common types of website backups:

1. **Database Backup**: Saves only the content and data (like blog posts, product information, and user accounts) without the website files.

2. **Website Files Backup**: Preserves the code, themes, and assets (images, documents) without the database content.

3. **Full-Site Backup**: A complete backup containing both the database and all website files.

Regular backups are essential for quick recovery in case of technical issues, security breaches, or data loss.

### Backup Strategy

A backup strategy is a comprehensive plan that defines how data is backed up, where it's stored, how often backups occur, and how restoration processes are handled. An effective backup strategy typically includes:

- Multiple backup types (incremental, differential, full)
- On-site and off-site storage locations
- Automated scheduling
- Regular testing of restoration procedures
- Retention policies for different data types
- Security measures for backup data

## C

### Care Plan

A Care Plan is our maintenance service package that keeps your website secure, up-to-date, and functioning optimally. Care Plans are labeled with a "cp" prefix followed by the number of maintenance hours included monthly (e.g., cp3.0 provides 3 hours per month or 36 hours annually).

### CMS

A Content Management System (CMS) is software used to create, manage, and modify digital contents (such as articles, images, blog posts & pages) on websites without needing specialized technical knowledge. It's essentially a user-friendly platform that allows people to build and maintain websites easily. There are many CMS software, the most popular CMS is WordPress.

### Collections

Collections is a set of content details about a particular item. For example, a `blog` is the collection of your `articles`. (A collection of your articles.)

Another example, if your site displays completed projects. You may want to have a collection for `Completed Works` that display every single `project` you have fulfilled.

Collections enables us to manage, organise & handle thousands of `items` (e.g. articles, projects) content in a much more structured way.

### Compliance

Compliance in website management refers to adhering to legal regulations, industry standards, and security requirements that govern how websites operate and handle data. This includes data protection laws (like GDPR in Europe or PDPA in Singapore), accessibility standards (WCAG), security protocols, and industry-specific regulations. Proper compliance protects both your business and your users by ensuring data is handled securely and that your website meets all necessary legal requirements.

### Custom Hardware

Custom hardware refers to specially designed and configured physical computing equipment created to fulfill specific business needs rather than using standard consumer or off-the-shelf devices. These solutions involve analyzing requirements, selecting appropriate components, assembling the hardware, and programming it to perform specialized tasks. Custom hardware may include industrial computers, IoT devices, specialized servers, monitoring equipment, or control systems tailored to unique operational requirements.

## D

### Data

Data that holds everything in your website and applications. This data is usually referred to the folder name 'root' which contains everything that is needed for your website and application to display online.

### Database

A database is a structured collection of information stored electronically. For websites, databases store content like blog posts, user accounts, product information, and settings. When you update your website content, you're typically changing information in the database, not editing the actual website files.

### Data Retention

Data retention refers to the policies that determine how long data is kept before being archived or deleted. In website maintenance, retention periods vary based on data type, business needs, and regulatory requirements. Longer retention periods provide more historical access but require more storage space and may create compliance issues with data protection regulations.

### Disaster Recovery

Disaster Recovery refers to the set of policies, tools, and procedures used to recover or continue technology infrastructure and systems after a natural or human-induced disaster. In website management, this involves having systems in place to quickly restore your website after events like server failures, cyberattacks, or data corruption. An effective disaster recovery plan includes regular backups stored in multiple locations, documented recovery procedures, and practiced restoration processes to minimize downtime and data loss.

### Docker

Docker is a term commonly referred as Docker image. It is way of configuring website or apps in a separate folder or known as 'containers'.

One of the key benefits of Docker is that it keeps everything isolated. This means your applications won't interfere with other applications within the same server, which enhances security and prevents conflicts.

Docker also helps you manage application versions, making it easy to track changes and revert to previous versions if necessary.

Lastly, Docker makes scaling your applications a breeze. You can easily manage and deploy multiple containers across different machines, ensuring your applications can grow as needed.

### Durability

Durability in cloud storage refers to the long-term data preservation capability, often expressed as a percentage (e.g., 99.999999999% or "eleven nines"). This indicates the probability that data will be preserved without corruption or loss. High durability storage is essential for critical business data, with redundancy across multiple physical locations to protect against hardware failures, natural disasters, or other potential data loss scenarios.

## E

### e-Commerce

Websites or applications that accept payments automatically is considered an e-Commerce. eCommerce, is a separate system on top of a website.
The size is huge (in Gigabytes) collectively, to perform what an e-Commerce store should. The larger an online store is, the more server resources it requires.

### Encryption

Encryption is the process of converting data into a coded format to prevent unauthorized access. In website security, encryption protects sensitive information during transmission (TLS/SSL) and storage (at-rest encryption). Modern encryption uses advanced algorithms that make the data extremely difficult to decode without the proper decryption keys, ensuring data remains secure even if intercepted or accessed improperly.

### Egress Fees

Egress fees are charges applied by cloud service providers for data transferred out of their network. These fees are typically calculated based on the volume of data (measured in GB or TB) that leaves the provider's infrastructure. When selecting storage providers, considering egress fee structures is important for applications that frequently serve large files or require frequent data retrieval, as these costs can significantly impact the total cost of ownership.

## F

### Full Backup

A full backup is a complete copy of all selected data at a specific point in time. Unlike incremental or differential backups that only capture changes, full backups contain everything needed for a complete restoration without requiring additional backup files. While full backups require more storage space and time to complete, they provide the fastest and most straightforward restoration process when needed.

## G

### GUI

A **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** is a type of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and visual indicators, as opposed to text-based interfaces, typed command labels, or text navigation. GUIs are commonly used in operating systems, software applications, and websites to make them more user-friendly and accessible.

## H

### Headless CMS

A headless CMS separates the content management from the presentation. It stores your content in a central location, but it doesn't dictate how and where that content is displayed.

This means you can use the same content across different platforms—like your website, mobile app, and even smart devices—without having to duplicate the work.

::: info Example:-
You have multiple websites like example.com and example2.com

Example.com sells structures that made out of wood, while example2.com sells only the wood.
Instead of creating two blogs for both websites, we only need to create one blog and talk about wood. We wouldn't need two seperate blogs to talk about the same thing.

So we need to create a Headless CMS so that those two websites can pull articles from the Headless CMS. There are many Headless CMS platforms and providers.
:::

### Hotlink Access

Hotlink access refers to the capability of directly accessing files or resources from their storage location without needing to download and reupload them. In website maintenance, hotlink access allows for direct streaming of media files from storage to a website, quick access to assets for modifications, reduced bandwidth usage, and faster update cycles for content that changes frequently.

### Hotlink

Hotlink is the same as above - a direct link from one application to another application that provides easy and fast access to resources without needing to download and reupload them.

## I

### Incremental Backup

An incremental backup captures only the data that has changed since the most recent backup (whether full or incremental). This approach significantly reduces backup time and storage requirements compared to full backups. However, restoration requires the last full backup plus all subsequent incremental backups, making the restoration process potentially longer and more complex than with full backups alone.

### Industrial-Grade Components

Industrial-grade components are hardware parts specifically designed for commercial or industrial use rather than consumer applications. These components are built to higher reliability standards with features such as:

- **Extended operating temperature ranges**: Functioning reliably in extreme environments
- **Enhanced durability**: Resistant to vibration, dust, moisture, and other harsh conditions
- **Longer lifecycle**: Designed for continuous operation over extended periods
- **Higher quality control**: Manufactured under stricter quality standards
- **Better performance**: Optimized for specific industrial applications

Industrial-grade components typically cost more than consumer equivalents but provide significantly greater reliability and longevity for business-critical applications.

### IP Filtering

IP filtering is a security measure that controls access to systems or data based on IP addresses. It can be configured to either allow (whitelist) or block (blacklist) specific IP addresses or ranges. In website security, IP filtering helps prevent unauthorized access, reduce brute force attacks, and create geographically restricted access to sensitive administrative functions.

## K

### Key Authentication

Key authentication (also known as key-based authentication) is a security method that uses cryptographic key pairs (public and private keys) instead of passwords to verify identity and grant access to systems. The private key remains securely on the user's device, while the public key is stored on the server. This method is more secure than password authentication because the private key never transmits over the network and is extremely difficult to crack through brute force methods.

## M

### Maintenance Fee

A maintenance fee is a recurring charge for ongoing services that keep hardware, software, or systems functioning properly. This fee covers regular updates, monitoring, security patching, troubleshooting, and technical support. Maintenance fees are typically calculated as a percentage of the initial project cost or as a fixed monthly/annual amount based on the complexity of the system being maintained. These fees ensure continued performance, security, and reliability of your technology investments.

### MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a security process that requires users to provide multiple forms of verification before gaining access to an account or system. These factors typically include:
- Something you know (password or PIN)
- Something you have (mobile device, security token, or authentication app)
- Something you are (biometric verification like fingerprint or facial recognition)

By requiring multiple types of credentials, MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access even if one factor is compromised, making it much more secure than single-factor authentication.

### Mission-Critical

A mission-critical website is a website that is essential to the functioning of a business or organization. If this website goes down or has issues, it can cause **significant** problems, such as loss of revenue, customer dissatisfaction, or operational disruptions.

Examples include e-commerce sites, web-applications, healthcare portals & organizations that heavily rely on the application.

## O

### Object Storage

Object storage is a data storage architecture that manages data as objects rather than as files or blocks. Each object includes the data, metadata (information about the data), and a unique identifier for easy retrieval. Object storage excels at storing unstructured data (like images, videos, documents) at massive scale, with virtually unlimited capacity. It's particularly well-suited for cloud applications, content delivery, backup/archive solutions, and applications requiring high durability and availability.

### On-Prem

Definition: Instead of cloud storage, this is a physical computer configured as a server in our office.

### On-Premises

On-premises (sometimes shortened to "on-prem") refers to software and hardware that is installed and runs on computers physically located on an organization's property rather than in remote cloud environments. On-premises solutions offer complete control over hardware, data, and security but require greater upfront investment and ongoing maintenance compared to cloud solutions. They're typically chosen when organizations have specific compliance requirements, need complete control over their infrastructure, or have workloads that don't translate cost-effectively to cloud environments.

## P

### Page Load Time

Definition: Time taken for a web page to fully load.
Measurement: Average load time in seconds.
Target: Less than 3 seconds.

### Plug-In

A plug-in, also known as an add-on or extension, is a software component that adds specific features to an existing software program. When a software supports plug-ins, it enables customization by allowing third-party developers to create and add features or functionalities that are not available in the original software.

### Programming Charge

A programming charge is a fee associated with developing custom software or configuring existing systems to meet specific requirements. This includes writing code, creating algorithms, developing user interfaces, integrating different systems, and testing the final solution. Programming charges typically reflect the complexity of the project, the expertise required, and the estimated development time. These charges may be calculated as a fixed project fee or as a percentage of the overall software cost.

## R

### RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)

RAID is a technology that combines multiple physical disk drives into one or more logical units for improved performance, reliability, or both. Different RAID levels offer varying combinations of redundancy, performance, and capacity:

- **RAID 0**: Stripes data across drives for improved performance but offers no redundancy
- **RAID 1**: Mirrors data for redundancy but uses 50% of available capacity
- **RAID 5**: Distributes parity data across all drives for balance of performance and redundancy
- **RAID 10**: Combines mirroring and striping for both performance and redundancy

RAID-10, used in our NAS storage, provides optimal protection against drive failures while maintaining high read/write performance.

### Redundancy

Redundancy in IT systems refers to the duplication of critical components or functions to ensure system reliability and availability if the primary component fails. For website infrastructure, redundancy may involve duplicate servers, network connections, power supplies, and data storage. Properly implemented redundancy eliminates single points of failure, enhancing system reliability while minimizing potential downtime during maintenance or component failures.

## S

### S3-Storage

Definition: S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a cloud-based object storage service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS).
It's designed to store and manage large amounts of data with high durability, availability, and scalability

### Scalability

Scalability is a system's ability to handle growing amounts of work by adding resources. In storage contexts, this means the capacity to increase storage space, processing capability, or throughput without redesigning the entire system. Vertical scalability (scaling up) involves adding more resources to existing infrastructure, while horizontal scalability (scaling out) involves adding more machines to a system. Highly scalable storage solutions can grow from gigabytes to petabytes without significant performance degradation.

### SFTP

Definition: Stands for Secure File Transfer Protocol, is a secure way to transfer files over a network.
It's an extension of the SSH (Secure Shell) protocol and provides a secure method for uploading, downloading, and managing files.

### Shared Hosting

Shared hosting is a web hosting service where multiple websites reside on a single web server. With this type of hosting, server resources (such as RAM, CPU, disk space, and bandwidth) are shared among all the websites on that server. Shared hosting is cost-effective and beginner-friendly, as the hosting provider handles all server maintenance, security updates, and technical configurations. However, because resources are shared, performance can be affected by other websites on the same server, making it best suited for small to medium-sized websites with moderate traffic levels.

### Site Visit

A site visit is an in-person service where technical professionals travel to a client's location to provide on-site support, conduct assessments, or implement solutions. Site visits may be necessary for hardware installations, network configurations, physical security assessments, or situations requiring direct interaction with systems that cannot be managed remotely. Site visit charges typically include travel time, on-site hours, and any materials or equipment needed for the service.

### SME

In Singapore, SMEs stands for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises. These businesses are defined based on their annual turnover and number of employees. Specifically, an SME in Singapore is a company with an annual turnover of less than SGD 100 million and fewer than 200 employees. SMEs is a plural of SME.

### Staging Environment

A staging environment is a replica of your live website used for testing changes before making them public. It allows developers to implement updates, test new features, and fix bugs in a safe environment without affecting the live site. After thorough testing in staging, changes can be confidently deployed to the production environment, minimizing the risk of disruptions or errors that could impact users.

## T

### TLD

Definition: A TLD stands for Top-Level Domain. It's the last part of a domain name that comes after the final dot.
For example, in the domain name example.com, the TLD is .com.

**Types of TLDs:**
**Generic TLDs (gTLDs):**<br> Commonly used and include .com, .net, .org, etc.

**Country Code TLDs (ccTLDs):**<br> Specific to countries, such as .sg for Singapore, .uk for the United Kingdom, and .my for Malaysia.

**Sponsored TLDs (sTLDs):**<br> Restricted to specific entities or communities, like .edu for educational institutions or .gov for government entities.

**Importance:**
**Branding:**<br> The TLD can affect the perceived credibility and memorability of a website.

**SEO:**<br> Search engines may use the TLD as a factor in ranking websites.

### TLS/SSL

TLS (Transport Layer Security) and its predecessor SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) are cryptographic protocols that provide secure communication over a computer network. These protocols:

- Encrypt data transmitted between servers and clients
- Authenticate the identity of the website through digital certificates
- Ensure data integrity by detecting any tampering during transmission

Websites using TLS/SSL display a padlock icon in the browser and use HTTPS instead of HTTP in their URL. This security is essential for any site that handles sensitive information like personal details or payment data.

## V

### Version Control

Version control is a system that records changes to files over time, allowing specific versions to be recalled later. In website maintenance, version control systems track changes to code, content, and configurations, providing:

- A complete history of modifications
- The ability to revert to previous versions
- Collaboration tools for multiple developers
- Branching and merging capabilities for parallel development
- Documentation of who made specific changes and why

Effective version control is essential for managing website updates, troubleshooting issues, and maintaining consistency across development environments.

### VPS

A VPS, or Virtual Private Server, is a virtualized server that mimics the functionalities of a dedicated physical server within a shared hosting environment. Here's a brief overview:

- **Isolation**: Each VPS runs its own operating system and applications, independent of other VPSs on the same physical server.

- **Resources**: You get dedicated resources like CPU, RAM, and storage, providing better performance & reliability compared to shared hosting.

- **Control**: Root access and administrative control, allowing efficient & optimised software as needed.

- **Scalability**: VPS servers are scalable, meaning you can easily upgrade or downgrade your resources based on your needs.

::: info 💡 Note:
VPS hosting provides more control, performance, and security compared to shared hosting, making it suitable for growing websites and businesses with higher demands. Shared hosting is a budget-friendly option for smaller websites with less resource-intensive needs.

## W

### WordPress

WordPress is the world's most popular content management system (CMS), powering over 40% of all websites on the internet. It began as a blogging platform but has evolved into a full-featured website building and management system. WordPress offers:

- **User-friendly interface**: Easy content creation and management without technical knowledge
- **Extensive customization**: Thousands of themes and plugins to extend functionality
- **SEO-friendly**: Built-in features that help with search engine visibility
- **Community support**: Large community of developers and users providing resources and assistance

WordPress comes in two versions: WordPress.org (self-hosted, requiring your own hosting service) and WordPress.com (hosted solution with varying subscription levels).

## Z

### Zero-Knowledge Privacy

Zero-knowledge privacy is a security protocol where the service provider has no ability to access or view a user's data or encryption keys. In cloud storage, this means that while the provider stores encrypted data, only the user possesses the encryption keys needed to decrypt it. This approach ensures maximum privacy and confidentiality, as not even the service provider can access the stored content, protecting against both external breaches and internal snooping.
