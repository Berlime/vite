### GUI: Graphical User Interface

A **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** is a type of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and visual indicators, as opposed to text-based interfaces, typed command labels, or text navigation. GUIs are commonly used in operating systems, software applications, and websites to make them more user-friendly and accessible.

### Headless CMS

A headless CMS separates the content management from the presentation. It stores your content in a central location, but it doesn't dictate how and where that content is displayed.

This means you can use the same content across different platforms—like your website, mobile app, and even smart devices—without having to duplicate the work.

::: info Example:-
You have multiple websites like example.com and example2.com

Example.com sells structures that made out of wood, while example2.com sells only the wood.
Instead of creating two blogs for both websites, we only need to create one blog and talk about wood. We wouldn't need two seperate blogs to talk about the same thing.

So we need to create a Headless CMS so that those two websites can pull articles from the Headless CMS. There are many Headless CMS platforms and providers.
