# Server Maintenance

Server maintenance involves the upkeep of the physical or virtual server where your website is hosted. This includes tasks like monitoring server performance, updating the operating system and software, ensuring security patches are applied, and performing regular backups.

The goal of server maintenance is to ensure that the server remains operational, secure, and performs optimally. 

It covers the underlying infrastructure that supports multiple websites and applications, maintaining the server's health and preventing hardware failures or security breaches.

## Not to be confused with Website Maintenance

<u>Server maintenance</u> and <u>website maintenance</u> are two distinct processes that serve different purposes, they are both crucial for the smooth functioning of your online presence.

Website maintenance focuses on the specific website itself. This encompasses updating website content, checking for and fixing broken links, optimizing website performance and many more.

Website maintenance aims to keep the website relevant, user-friendly, and secure from vulnerabilities that could arise from outdated components. It ensures that visitors to the website have a seamless and engaging experience.

## Firewall Rules

Firewall rules for a server are essential configurations that define which incoming and outgoing traffic is allowed or blocked based on predetermined security criteria. These rules act as a protective barrier, helping to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and various cyber threats.

They can be set to allow or deny specific IP addresses, protocols, or ports, effectively controlling the flow of data to and from the server.

For most cases, We use third-party server managers to manage all VPS instances.
